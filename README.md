# MSP430WIFI
An embedded system that measures the temperature of the atmosphere using LM35 Temperature Sensor, and also detect the Light-Level in the atmosphere using LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), developed using the MSP430G2553 microprocessor,  and ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.   The Data of the sensors and  historical statistics  are visualized on a  live-updating cloud server (ThingSpeak).
